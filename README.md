# Quantization Energy Efficiency

This repository provides a script and resources for analyzing the energy efficiency of different quantization methods applied to the [Stable Diffusion 3.5 model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large) during image generation. It aims to support articles and discussions around energy-efficient AI, particularly in the context of generative models.

## Overview

The script evaluates the effects of quantization on:
- **Inference Performance**: Time required for image generation.
- **GPU Memory Usage**: Peak memory allocated during inference.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Power consumption and energy usage during inference.

The repository uses creative prompts to measure the impact of quantization on the quality and energy efficiency of image generation.

## Quantization Methods

The following quantization methods are evaluated in the script:

| Quantization Type  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NF4**            | 4-bit quantization using the `nf4` type with computation in `torch.bfloat16`. |
| **FP4**            | 4-bit quantization using the `fp4` type with computation in `torch.bfloat16`. |
| **8-bit**          | 8-bit quantization for efficient inference with minimal quality degradation. |
| **Mixed Precision**| Default mode using `torch.float16` without any explicit quantization.       |

## Prompts

The script tests multiple creative prompts to ensure a comprehensive analysis. Each prompt is paired with a negative prompt to avoid undesirable characteristics like low quality or unrealistic imagery.

| Prompt | Negative Prompt |
|--------|------------------|
| **Prompt 1**: A creative image of a waffle-hippopotamus hybrid basking in melted butter, with pancake-like foliage in the background. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 2**: An enchanting modern oil painting of a transparent glass unicorn with iridescent mane, nibbling vibrant flowers in a magical meadow at sunset. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 3**: A girl with an umbrella and sky-blue eyes looking directly at the viewer. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 4**: A dreamy forest pattern in doodle style featuring a majestic dragon with intricate, swirling designs and vibrant colors. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 5**: An abstract artwork titled 'brake eggs' exploring vibrant hues and textured strokes, evoking sensory experience and synesthesia. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 6**: A romantic scene of a fallen angel and a saint on a date at a trendy rooftop caf√©, blending urban nightlife with celestial elements. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 7**: An extremely minimalist, symmetrical, almost transparent flower with simple lines on a pale palette, focusing on elegance and balance. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
| **Prompt 8**: Little Red Riding Hood converses with a detailed robotic wolf in an enchanted forest, surrounded by lifelike fuzzy bunnies hopping around. | blurry, low-quality, unrealistic, oversaturated, distorted proportions |
